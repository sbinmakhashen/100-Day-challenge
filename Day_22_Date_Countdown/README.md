<h1 align="center">This is a countdown for "Eid ul Adha" holiday </h1>

## <p align='center'> What is Eid ul Adha? it is a festival celebrated among Muslims all over the world in remembrance of the sacrifice that Prophet Ibrahim (A.S.) made out of his strong faith in Allah. Ibrahim (AS) showed a willingness to sacrifice his son Prophet Ismail (A.S.) but his son was replaced with a lamb by Allah. Allah was so pleased with Ibrahim’s (A.S.) submission to Him that He made this demonstration of sacrifice and faith a permanent part of a Muslim’s life. This event is mentioned in Quran - Surah As-Saffat (37:102). Hence, every year on the 10th of Dhul Hijjah, Muslims all over the world celebrate Eid ul Azha. On this day, Muslims slaughter a lamb, sheep, goat or a camel to honor the sacrifice of Ibrahim (AS).</p>
